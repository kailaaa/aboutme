<p>
olleyball is a team sport played with a ball and a net. There are teams on each side of the net. One team hits the ball over the net and into the other team's court, the other team must then hit the ball back over the net and in bounds within three tries without letting the ball touch the ground. 

There are two main kinds of competitive volleyball played in the world right now. They are team volleyball and beach volleyball. Both are Olympic sports and have competitive leagues. Team volleyball is played indoors on a hard court with 6 people per team. Beach volleyball is played outdoors on the sand with 2 players per team. The rules, strategy, and discussion here will focus on team volleyball. 

Volleyball can be a lot of fun to play. To play with friends you can play with any number of people and most anyone can join in. To be a competitive player takes lot of practice. Good height and jumping ability helps a lot.
